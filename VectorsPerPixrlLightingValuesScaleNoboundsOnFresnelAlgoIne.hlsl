//this would be good to orevent high scale noise on a previously used texture before zoom in.
//A gaussian algorithm can overcome this.




//The next step of the zoom in would be to zoom deeper with a correlated texture that simplify
//the gaussian process above. so we can use holomorph functions to overcome the second zoom in on
//correlated textures. The result would be to select a cleaarcoat texture that would be painted
//with a close range of blue channels. So this is a loop. Then, can overcome this second issue with correlated
//procedural textures. I mean we have both procedural correlated textures and painted textures.



//To prevent having only a global view of the parameters sent to GPU, we can turn clusters to models.
//The latent space could not be refactored here. So, once again, we need to select clearcoat textures.
//This is here, only here, a computer vision process. So, the fresnel is usefull.
